# Scenario Test Specification Template
This is a scenario test specification template.  
## How to write scenario test specification  
### Title  
We should write the following information in the title page.  

- Title
- Description of the test
- Test date
- Tester
- Required time
- Test result summary

### Result status  
We hope there are 3 result statuses at least.  

- OK
- Attention
- NG

It is difficult for us to prevent to make specification bugs.  
If we get a feeling of strangeness, we will set Attention at the result.  

### Test specification basis  
- Anybody can get same software behaviors
- Anybody can decide same results (OK or NG)
